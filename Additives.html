            3D printing using powders has its flaws. Although powders are made of fewer materials than entire foods, storing multiple years’ worth is still a considerable amount. 
            Furthermore, although they last significantly longer than other methods, like all things, powders will eventually break down over time, making it uncertain whether they will survive an entire deep space mission. 
            Through the utilization of other technologies, the limitations of powders can be significantly reduced, skyrocketing this solution from plausible to perfect.

            <span class="titleText" style="margin: 0">1. Cultured Meat</span><br/><br/>
            Cells from an animal, such as a cow, are harvested and given the resources needed to grow (carbohydrates and amino acids), causing them to multiply. 
            The process is meant to mimic the natural process of muscle-tissue regeneration occurring within an animal’s body, and over time, full, edible meat tissues form. 
            Initially, only a few cells and the materials needed to sustain the growth are sent into space where they can subsequently self-propagate for the duration of the trip. 
            As the need arises, cells can be fed into a 3D printer, transforming them into an accessible form of meat in space. 
            This technology has already been utilized on Earth in the form of lab-grown meats and is steadily becoming commercially available to consumers.

            <span class="titleText" style="margin: 0">2. Hydrogenotrophs</span><br/><br/>
            Alongside meat, hydrogenotrophs can be employed to create additional types of proteins. 
            Hydrogenotrophs are a type of bacteria that can harvest energy using only hydrogen and carbon dioxide. 
            They require no light and a large quantity can be cultivated in a small space, something that is scarce in spacecraft.
            Through fermentation, the bacteria consume hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce proteins that can be used to create non-meat items ranging from solid vegetables to liquids, oils, and many other products in between. 
            This process is similar to how beer and yogurt are produced on Earth and can occur exponentially faster than traditional meat production. 
            The proteins are also incredibly nutritious, containing all nine amino acids and twice the amount of amino acids of soybeans, while also being rich in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.

            <span class="titleText" style="margin: 0">3. Arthrospira plantensis</span><br/><br/>
            Finally, <i>Arthrospira platensis</i>, also known as Spirulina, is a type of cyanobacteria that can provide many of the remaining nutrients astronauts currently lack. 
            Since ancient times, spirulina has been known to be a superfood, consisting of 55-80% protein, 15-25% carbohydrates, and 18% essential fatty acids in addition to vitamins, minerals, and pigments. 
            These supplements are of such high quality that space agencies such as NASA have advertised them as a supplement for astronauts during their own space missions. 
            Even small amounts are able to supply an extensive variety of nutrients and protective effects. 
            Worldwide, it is the second most commercially produced microalgae and is used as a food/food additive in the form of tablets, powders, nectar, and noodles. 
            Similar to cultured meat and hydrogenotrophs, spirulina would provide a source of nutrient-dense, self-sustaining, fresh food, while requiring no soil and very little space to grow. 
            In addition, it is able to absorb sums of the carbon dioxide produced by the respiration of the astronauts and ward off the harmful effects of space radiation with its antioxidant content.

            On its own, 3D printing would significantly reduce the number of materials needed to be brought into space. 
            Powders are much more condensed than whole foods and have much longer shelf lives. 
            Consequently, this method lowers costs significantly and creates much-needed room for additional scientific instruments on long-term space missions. 
            Having an on-demand printer also makes it easier to meet nutritional needs; any nutrient or mineral requirements can be easily incorporated into the food’s design. 
            Similarly, astronauts are given a wide variety of nourishment as well, creating palatable foods that assist them with maintaining both their physical and mental health [12].

            Although a significant improvement from current technologies, 3D printing still has its flaws. 
            Even though powders are made of fewer materials than entire foods, storing multiple years’ worth is still a considerable amount.
