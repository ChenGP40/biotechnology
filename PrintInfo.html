            During 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, a digital file is used to create a three-dimensional solid object. 
            A printer places layer after layer of material until the desired thing is “printed”. 
            Each layer can be considered a finely sliced cross-section of the printed item. 
            Typically, this process is used in manufacturing items, but it can also be applied to food and beverages.

            A food 3D printer heats up or liquifies edible ingredients before printing them on the build plate.<br/>
            Astronauts can produce food using the same techniques employed by engineers and scientists around the world. 
            CAD (computer-aided design) software can be used to design and export creations, printing edible materials as a final product.

            Unflavored macronutrients such as protein or starch can be stored as dry powders and are fed directly to a 3D printer, where oil or water would be mixed in at the printhead.<br/><br/>
            Through this process, powders can be made and shipped from the ground, with the rest of the process able to be performed in space by astronauts.

            Similar to a traditional 3D printer, food is assembled layer by layer, compiling the different components of the dish along the way. 
            The printer can be used to construct purees and other beverages through various combinations of liquids and powders.<br/>
            This close-up of a 3D printer shows that the ink that was once a powder is being distributed in layers to create food.

            On its own, 3D printing would significantly reduce the number of materials needed to be brought into space. 
            Powders are much more condensed than whole foods and have much longer shelf lives. 
            Consequently, this method lowers costs significantly and creates much-needed room for additional scientific instruments on long-term space missions. 
            Having an on-demand printer also makes it easier to meet nutritional needs; any nutrient or mineral requirements can be easily incorporated into the food’s design. 
            Similarly, astronauts are given a wide variety of nourishment as well, creating palatable foods that assist them with maintaining both their physical and mental health [12].

            Although a significant improvement from current technologies, 3D printing still has its flaws. 
            Even though powders are made of fewer materials than entire foods, storing multiple years’ worth is still a considerable amount. 
            Furthermore, although they last significantly longer than other methods, like all things, powders will eventually break down over time, making it uncertain whether they will survive an entire deep space mission.
